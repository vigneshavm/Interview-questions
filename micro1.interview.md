# Coding exercise
```
You are tasked with developing a system for a busy restaurant to manage its waiting list. The restaurant uses a unique seating strategy: when a table becomes available, they seat the group that has been waiting the longest AND can fit at the table. If no waiting group can fit the available table, it remains empty until a suitable group arrives. Implement a function processWaitingList(waitingGroups, availableTables) that takes two parameters: 1. waitingGroups: A queue of integers representing the size of each waiting group in the order they arrived. 2. availableTables: An array of integers representing the capacity of each available table. The function should return an array of integers representing the size of the groups that were seated, in the order they were seated. If a table remains empty, represent it with a 0 in the output array.

EXAMPLE 1
Input:waitingGroups: [4, 2, 6, 3, 5]
availableTables: [4, 6, 2, 8]

Output:[4, 6, 2, 5]

Explanation:First, a group of 4 is seated at the table for 4. Then, a group of 6 is seated at the table for 6. The group of 2 is seated at the table for 2. Finally, the group of 5 is seated at the table for 8. The group of 3 remains waiting.

EXAMPLE 2
Input:waitingGroups: [2, 3, 4]
availableTables: [2, 4, 6]

Output:[2, 3, 4]

Explanation:All groups are seated in order: 2 at the table for 2, 3 at the table for 4, and 4 at the table for 6.

Requirements
1. Implement the seating logic as described
2. Use appropriate data structures (queue for waiting groups, array for tables)
3. Optimize for efficiency, considering both time and space complexity
4. Handle edge cases, such as when there are more tables than groups or vice versa
5. Ensure the function works correctly for various input sizes and group/table combinations
```


----------Solution-------- 
Here are the **solutions** and explanations to your coding exercise, followed by concise answers to the **Node.js** and **AWS** questions.

## **Coding Exercise Solution**

The problem involves matching waiting groups to tables based on their sizes. A group can only sit at a table if their size **fits the table capacity**. We'll simulate this using a queue for `waitingGroups` and an array for `availableTables`.

### **Approach**
1. Use a queue (FIFO) to process `waitingGroups`.
2. Traverse the `availableTables` in order. For each table:
   - Find the first group in the queue that can fit into the table.
   - Seat the group and remove it from the queue.
   - If no group can fit, place `0` for that table.
3. Return an array with the results (seated group sizes or `0` for empty tables).

### **Time Complexity**
- Traversing `availableTables` and checking groups for each table costs **O(m Ã— n)**, where `m` = tables and `n` = groups.
- This is acceptable as the problem involves matching and checking conditions.

### **Code Implementation**

```javascript
function processWaitingList(waitingGroups, availableTables) {
    const result = []; // Final output
    const queue = [...waitingGroups]; // Copy of the waiting groups (queue-like behavior)
  
    for (const table of availableTables) {
        let seated = false; // Track if a group is seated
  
        // Try to seat a group that fits the table capacity
        for (let i = 0; i < queue.length; i++) {
            if (queue[i] <= table) {
                result.push(queue[i]); // Seat the group
                queue.splice(i, 1); // Remove the group from the queue
                seated = true;
                break;
            }
        }
  
        if (!seated) {
            result.push(0); // No group could fit this table
        }
    }
  
    return result;
}

// Example 1
console.log(processWaitingList([4, 2, 6, 3, 5], [4, 6, 2, 8])); // Output: [4, 6, 2, 5]

// Example 2
console.log(processWaitingList([2, 3, 4], [2, 4, 6])); // Output: [2, 3, 4]

// Example Edge Case
console.log(processWaitingList([1, 2, 3], [5, 5])); // Output: [1, 2]
```

## **Node.js Questions**

### 1. **How do you handle scalability issues in Node.js applications?**
   - **Clustering**: Use the `cluster` module to utilize multi-core systems by spawning worker processes.
   - **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming requests across multiple servers using NGINX, HAProxy, or AWS Elastic Load Balancer.
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: Deploy multiple instances of the application using containers (e.g., Docker) and orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
   - **Caching**: Use Redis or Memcached to cache frequently accessed data.
   - **Optimize Queries**: Use efficient database queries and indexing.

---

### 2. **How do you ensure data consistency across distributed services?**
   - Use distributed transaction mechanisms like **two-phase commit**.
   - Implement **event-driven architecture** with message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for eventual consistency.
   - Use database strategies like **write-ahead logs** and **saga patterns** for managing consistency.

---

### 3. **How do you handle callback hell in Node.js?**
   - Use **Promises** to flatten the callback chain.
   - Use **async/await** for better readability and linear flow.
   - Modularize code into smaller functions for better maintainability.

---

### 4. **Promises vs Async/Await**
   - Promises simplify callbacks but can still become complex.
   - **Async/await** allows writing asynchronous code like synchronous code, improving readability.
   - Async/await works on top of promises and eliminates `.then()` chains.

---

### 5. **How do you manage security in Node.js applications?**
   - **Input Validation**: Use libraries like Joi or Express-validator to validate inputs.
   - **Sanitize Data**: Prevent SQL injections and XSS attacks.
   - **Authentication**: Use JWT or OAuth for secure authentication.
   - **Environment Variables**: Store secrets securely using `dotenv` or AWS Secrets Manager.
   - **Rate Limiting**: Use middleware to limit requests (e.g., `express-rate-limit`).
   - **Helmet**: Protect HTTP headers for Express apps.

---

## **AWS Questions**

### 1. **How do you handle cost optimization in AWS?**
   - Use **Reserved Instances** and **Spot Instances** for predictable workloads.
   - Use **AWS Auto-Scaling** to scale resources dynamically.
   - Monitor usage with **AWS CloudWatch** and set up budgets in **AWS Cost Explorer**.
   - Optimize storage with lifecycle rules (e.g., S3 Glacier for archiving).

---

### 2. **How do you manage security best practices in AWS?**
   - Use **IAM Roles** and **policies** to enforce the principle of least privilege.
   - Enable **CloudTrail** and **VPC flow logs** for monitoring.
   - Use **Security Groups** and **NACLs** to control network access.
   - Encrypt data in transit (TLS) and at rest (KMS).

---

### 3. **How do you approach monitoring and logging in AWS?**
   - Use **CloudWatch** for monitoring logs, metrics, and alarms.
   - Use **AWS X-Ray** for tracing application performance.
   - Enable **CloudTrail** for auditing AWS API calls.
   - Integrate with external tools like ELK Stack or Datadog.

---

### 4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in AWS**
   - Use **AWS CloudFormation** or tools like **Terraform** to define infrastructure as code.
   - Automate deployment pipelines using **AWS CodePipeline** or Jenkins.
